        <h2>Reservoir Engineer (Ph.D., EIT)</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am a petroleum engineer with a research focus on reservoir engineering, data analytics,
            simulation and economic analysis of conventional and unconventional oil and gas formations. As a teaching
            assistant at Texas Tech University, I taught over 800 students during my MS and doctoral programs. I taught
            more than six classes, teaching some of them multiple times. During this period, I participated in several
            projects, some of which resulted in journal or conference publications <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1j-si4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">(Google Scholar)</a>.
            Some of the projects were sponsored by oil and gas companies and professional organizations.
            My <strong><em>teaching interests</em></strong> include reservoir engineering, rock mechanics, rock and fluid
            properties, drilling engineering, pressure transient analysis, production engineering, oil and gas property
            evaluation and management, and oil and gas data analysis. My <strong><em>research interests </em></strong>
            include data analytics and web application development, machine learning, reservoir simulation, unconventional
            resources, reservoir fluid and rock properties, hydraulic fracturing, rock mechanics, and economic analysis/
            petroleum economics. I am a <strong><em>reviewer</em></strong> for reputable journals like Elsevier’s Journal
            of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Taylor and Francis’ Cogent Engineering, and Springer’s Journal of
            Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology. I also reviewed conference papers and abstracts for American
            Rock Mechanics Association (ARMA) and Southwestern Petroleum Short Course (SWPSC). See
            <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">List of Publications</a>.

            <p><em>Reservoir Engineer (<a href="contact-me.html" target="_blank">Contact me</a>)</em></p>

            <p>I am a petroleum engineer with a research focus on reservoir engineering, data analytics, simulation and
                economic analysis of conventional and unconventional oil and gas formations. As a teaching assistant at
                Texas Tech University, I taught over 800 students during my MS and doctoral programs. I taught more than
                six classes, teaching some of them multiple times. During this period, I participated in several
                projects, some of which resulted in journal or conference publications
                (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1j-si4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>).
                Some of the projects were sponsored by oil and gas companies and professional organizations. My <strong>
                    <em>teaching interests</em></strong> include reservoir engineering, rock mechanics, rock and fluid
                properties, drilling engineering, pressure transient analysis, production engineering, oil and gas
                property evaluation and management, and oil and gas data analysis. My <strong><em>research interests
                </em></strong> include data analytics and web application development, machine learning, reservoir
                simulation, unconventional resources, reservoir fluid and rock properties, hydraulic fracturing, rock
                mechanics, and economic analysis/petroleum economics. I am a <strong><em>reviewer</em></strong> for
                reputable journals like Elsevier’s Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, Taylor and Francis’
                Cogent Engineering, and Springer’s Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology. I also
                reviewed conference papers and abstracts for American Rock Mechanics Association (ARMA) and Southwestern
                Petroleum Short Course (SWPSC). See <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">List of Publications</a>
